					<h4>Studies into the Human Genome and Possible Environmental Proponents of Neurodiversity
						<br>(These studies are focused on ASD)
					</h4>
						<p>Recent studies seek to understand whether autism is built in to the human genome, or if there are genetic predispositions to changes that may be induced by 
							developmental and/or environmental factors. More research is required.<br>
