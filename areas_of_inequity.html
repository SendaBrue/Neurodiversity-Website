					<h3>Who are affected by Neurodiversity Inequities and how?</h3>
					<p></p>

<!-- According to the CDC -->

					<h3>According to the CDC:<sub><cite id="fn8"><a href="#fn8"> [8]</a></cite></sub></h3>
					<p>Research suggests fewer young people with ASD have the same opportunities as their peers without ASD.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>High rates of unemployment or under-employment</li>
							<li>Low participation in education beyond high school</li>
							<li>Majority continue to live with family members or relatives </li>
							<li>Limited opportunity for community or social activities—nearly 40% spend little or no time with friends</li>
							<li>In addition, individuals with ASD may experience changes in their ASD symptoms, behaviors, and co-occurring health conditions during adolescence and young adulthood. 
								These changes can affect their ability to function and participate in the community.</li>
						</ul>

	<!-- School Age Children -->

					<h3>School Age Children</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>UnIdentified and Undiagnosed Individuals do not receive needed services
							<a href="https://www.livingonthespectrum.com/education/too-many-neurodiverse-children-dont-have-a-full-diagnosis-heres-why/">
								https://www.livingonthespectrum.com/education/too-many-neurodiverse-children-dont-have-a-full-diagnosis-heres-why/</a></li>
						<li>Individual Education Plans (IEPs) are difficult to aquire</li>
						<li>IEPs are accomidations, still afterthoughts rather than developed education for all</li>
						<li>Neurodiverse Children are often thougth to just have behavioral issues rather than individual frustrations
							and difficulty with currently formed education system teaching standards.</li>
						<li>IEPs often pull students out of general classes for "other education or services", creating feelings of isolation
							or "being the odd student".</li>
						<li>IEPs are inadequate and there is a lack of teachers trained for Neurodivergent Education</li>
						<li>Teaching Neurodivergent Individuals should be part of all teaching degree education.</li>

					<h3>Transition from Teen to Adult</h3>
					<div>
						<blockquote class="contentQuote"><em>For all of the attention that the rising prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children has received in recent years, there has been little focus on what happens when 
							children with autism transition into adulthood.
							<cite id="fn9"></cite><sub><a href="#fn9"> [9]</a></em></sub></em></blockquote>
						<h4>The following is from the Article <em>People With ASD May Struggle During Transition Into Adulthood,</em></e>referenced <cite id="fn9"></cite><sub><a href="#fn9"> [9]:</a></sub></h4>
						<p>"While trying to uncover genes and other risk factors tied to ASD or developing ways to diagnose the disorder as early as possible are laudable goals, Anne Roux, M.P.H., 
							a research scientist at the A.J. Drexel Autism Institute at Drexel University in Philadelphia, says this focus is leaving a large population underserved.
							</p><p>Roux believes such misconceptions may contribute to the dearth of knowledge or guidance available to help teens with ASD gain the skills or resources they will need as adults.
							Secondary schools do provide many needed services such as counseling, speech therapy, and other developmental programs. There are also federal requirements that adolescents with autism have a transition 
							plan—a vision for the future (for example, enroll in college) and how family, school, and other services help the adolescent accomplish his or her goal—in place by the age of 16.
							</p><p>However, a recent study by Roux and her colleagues suggests that less than 60 percent of adolescents with ASD receive assistance with transition planning from the schools.
							'Once high school ends, people with autism really start to flounder,” said Roux, “even more so than young adults with other intellectual or learning disabilities.'
							</p><p>The 'National Autism Indicators Report: Transition Into Young Adulthood' shows, that after high school, only 36 percent of people with ASD went on to receive postsecondary education, 58 percent were employed 
							(although a majority worked part-time and/or earned low wages), and only 19 percent lived independently. In comparison, around 75 percent of high school graduates in the general population enroll in some 
							postsecondary education and half of young adults aged 18 to 24 live away from home.
							</p><p>'After 18, when autism services stop, we see that so many people with this condition are not in school or work, so they’re not in an environment where they can develop their adaptive behaviors', says 
							Nicole Matthews, Ph.D., a researcher at the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center in Phoenix.

					<h3>Adults</h3>
					<h4>Common areas of inadequate services for Neurodivergent Adults:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Housing for Diverse Needs</li>
						<li>Housing Costs</li>
						<li>Healthcare Costs</li>
						<li>Mental Health Services Availabile and Access to Services</li>
						<li>Transportation</li>
						<li>Employment</li>
						<li>No Advocates or Guardians</li>

						<blockquote class="contentQuote"><em><h3>John Elder Robison Points Out:</h3><br>"After many years of struggle, it’s against the law to discriminate against someone because of race or faith anywhere in America. 
							Unfortunately, we have not come that far in other areas. It’s still legal to fire someone for being gay in many states. People who act differently by virtue of their neurology have no protections other than 
							those general ones afforded under the Americans With Disabilities Act."<sub><cite id="fn6"><a href="#fn6"> [6]</a></cite></sub></em></blockquote>
						<p>In March 2014, the Wall Street Journal reported that 85% of autistic people in the US are unemployed or underemployed and 60% of them have cognitive abilities at or above those of neurotypical people. 
							A 2016 study by the National Autistic Society in the UK arrived at a similar conclusion. A United Nations proclamation on World Autism Day 2016 estimated that more than 80% of autistic adults around the world 
							are unemployed.<sub><cite id="fn7"><a href="#fn7"> [7]</a></cite></sub></p>
						<p>Neurodivergent Adults without good support systems can find themselves left completely on their own after high school to navigate life, houseing, employment, and complicated systems
							required to recieve potentially inadequate services.</p>
