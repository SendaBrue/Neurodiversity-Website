					<h3>Changing A Stigma</h3>
					<p>“Neurodivergence can be associated with disability and mental illness but not in all cases. Some people who are neurodivergent may also have a disability, 
						or their neurodivergence may be disabling in certain circumstances.”<br>
						<br>“Neurodivergent people can also be diagnosed with other mental health conditions. In fact, two of every three people with ADHD have another condition 
						such as anxiety, depression or OCD, and autistic people are at higher risk for mental health conditions.”

	<!-- Not a Dysfunction -->

						<h3>Not a Dysfunction</h3>
					<p>This epidemic in the growth of mental illness suggests that there is a crisis in the making.  How much longer can we continue to add new psychiatric illnesses 
						to the list, before it becomes apparent that we have moved too far in pathologizing a sizeable chunk of the American populace?  There is, however, an answer to 
						this crisis.  The concept of neurodiversity provides a paradigm shift in how we think about mental functioning.  Instead of regarding large portions of the 
						American public as suffering from deficit, disease, or dysfunction in their mental processing, neurodiversity suggests that we instead speak about differences in 
						cognitive functioning.  Just as we talk about differences in bio-diversity and cultural diversity, we need to start using the same kind of thinking in talking about 
						brain differences.  We don’t pathologize a calla lily for not having petals (e.g. petal deficit disorder), nor do we diagnose an individual with brown skin as 
						suffering from a “pigmentation dysfunction.”  Similarly, we ought not to pathologize individuals who have different ways of thinking, relating, attending, and learning<br>
						- Thomas Armstrong, Ph.D<sub><cite id="fn5"></cite><a href="#fn5"> [5]</a></sub></p>
					<blockquote class="contentQuote"><em>Indeed, many individuals who embrace the concept of neurodiversity believe that people with differences do not need to be cured; they need 
						help and accommodation instead. They look at the pool of diverse humanity and see—in the middle—the range of different thinking that’s made humanity’s progress in science 
						and the creative arts possible. At the edges, they see people who are functionally crippled by being “too diverse.” When 99 neurologically identical people fail to solve a problem, 
						it’s often the 1% fellow who’s different who holds the key. Yet that person may be disabled or disadvantaged most or all of the time. To neurodiversity proponents, people are 
						disabled because they are at the edges of the bell curve; not because they are sick or broken.<br>-John Elder Robison<sub><cite id="fn6"><a href="#fn6"> [6]</a></cite></sub></em></blockquote>
