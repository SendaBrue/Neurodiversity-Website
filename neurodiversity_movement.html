<!-- What Now -->
					
							<h3>What Now?</h3>
					<p>According to Thomas Armstrong, Ph.D, "The potential is great for the neurodiversity movement to create significant social transformation."</p>
					<p>"Already, for example, there are software firms 
						that have recognized the special programming gifts of certain people with Asperger's syndrome and others on the autistic spectrum, and have hired significant 
						numbers of them to improve their productivity.  Similarly, more people are understanding that ADHD brings with it special abilities as well as difficulties, and that 
						appropriate career selection can be an important part of determining whether one will be successful or unsuccessful in a particular job. It is hoped that the concept 
						of neurodiversity will help combat “ableism” or the belief that people who are “abnormal” should be discriminated against, condescended to, and ultimately kept out of 
						the basic affairs of society.  Neurodiversity brings with it a sense of hope, that all individuals, regardless of how they read, think, feel, socialize, or attend, 
						will be recognized for their gifts, and accorded the same rights and privileges as any other human being."

<!-- How to Support -->
					
						<h3>How to support someone who is neurodivergent:</h3>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Listen.</b> People who are neurodivergent may feel misunderstood or left out. Be willing to listen to them. Let them know you hear them and respect them and 
							their choices.</li>
						<li><b>Communicate in ways that help them.</b> Sometimes, people who are neurodivergent prefer written communication such as instant messaging, texting or emails 
							over a phone call or face-to-face conversation. Give them the time and tools they need to communicate.</li>
						<li><b>Avoid value-based labels.</b> Experts recommend against using the terms “high-functioning” and “low-functioning” to describe conditions like autism. 
							They often assume a person's level of function based on how much they behave like someone who's neurotypical.</li>
						<li><b>No two neurodivergent people are the same.</b> The personalities and preferences of neurodivergent people can be widely different, even when they have the same 
							underlying condition.</li>
						<li><b>Don't assume that anyone is incapable or unintelligent.</b> People who are neurodivergent often have conditions or preferences that make them stand out or appear different.</li>
						<li><b>Treat everyone with respect.</b> You can “normalize” and provide others with accommodations in a way that honors their human dignity.</li><sub><cite id="fn3"></cite><a href="#fn3"> [3]</a></sub>
					</ol>

					<h3>Neurodiversity Movement</h3>
					<blockquote class="contentQuote"><em>According to Judy Singer, an important advocate in the Neurodiversity Movement:<br>
						"Despite there being no official definition or spokesperson for the movement, its consesual aims can be discerned. They are to:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Shift mainstream perceptions of marginalized NeuroMinorities</li>
							<li>Replace negative, deficit-based stereotypes of NeuroMinorities with a more balanced valuation of their gifts and needs</li>
							<li>Find valued roles for neurologically marginalized people</li>
							<li>Show that all society benefits from the incorporation of NeuroMinorities.</li>
						</ul><cite id="fn7"></cite><sub><a href="#fn7"> [7]</a></sub></em></blockquote>
